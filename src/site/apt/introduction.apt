Java Text Adventure Game

* Introduction

    {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game}Text Adventures}}, also known as 
    {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Fiction}Interactive Fiction}} (IF), 
    convey the game's story through passages of text, revealed to the player in 
    response to typed instructions. Early text adventures, such as 
    {{{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure}Colossal Cave Adventure}},
    used a simple verb-noun parser to interpret these instructions, allowing the player
    to interact with objects at a basic level, for example by typing <<<get key>>> or 
    <<<open door>>>.

    JAdventure is a very simple Java based implementation of a
    Text Adventure.
    
    [WARNING]
    
    The current version has only one concrete Text Adventure game implemented. But it should be easy
    to create additional games. See also {{{./development/improvement-ideas.html}Improvement Ideas}}
