Improvement Ideas

* Suggestions

  * Rename LocationRepository to WorldRepository, as it contains the games world.

  * Add support for multiple games
  
    This should relative easy, as the game is already stored on disk (in json format).
    A concrete sollution could be to store each game in a separate file 'world-xxx.json'.
    Or each game in it's own directory like  game-data/${world-name}/world.json; items.json; etc
