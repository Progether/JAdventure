To help make code more readable, understandable, and consistent, each contributor should follow the set guidelines lain out below. If you disagree with something or come across a style that has not been decided upon, make an issue or a pull request respectively for discussion on the best style. The standard will be decided based on either majority rule or official documentation (i.e. oracle coding standard).

 1. Space width is 4
 1. No beginning/trailing empty lines
 1. Each file should start with an import statement if necessary single-spaced
 1. After class declaration and between class methods, there should be a space.
 1. Within methods, there should be no spaces unless to separate specific chuncks of code (i.e not for if statements, return values, or loops)
 1. Opening curly braces appear a space after the closing parentheses, not directly after.
 1. Closing curly braces appear on own line unless followed by an else etc. which will be a space after the curly brace.
